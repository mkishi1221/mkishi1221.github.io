# Here's a TL;DR on my career:

I’m a high-impact product leader with a strong background in design and software development. I've led teams in the UK and Japan and worked in **customer-facing product roles**, at both early-stage startups and large enterprises.

- **I have deep experience driving early-stage products to adoption** by tracking success via experiments using scrappy prototypes, and customer workshops securing enterprise traction and early funding.
- **My superpower is being able to learn anything under pressure** and using that knowledge to have deep, meaningful conversations that build trust, align cross-functional teams, and drive products to success.
- **I’m a versatile leader with my head in the clouds and feet on the ground** moving fluidly between big-picture strategy and detailed execution across product, engineering, marketing and sales.
- **I care deeply about creating inclusive teams** where people feel safe, supported, and empowered. I’ve supported team growth by fostering clear communication, collaborative decision-making, and space for personal development.
