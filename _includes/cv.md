# Here's a TL;DR on my career:

I’m a product leader with a background in design and software development. I've led teams in the UK and Japan and worked in **customer-facing product roles**, at both early-stage startups and large enterprises.

- **I’ve launched products as a founder and led early-stage products** that secured six-figure pilots with enterprise customers. I bring hands-on experience across design, development, and team leadership, translating early insights into revenue.
- **I thrive on shaping complex, cross-disciplinary products** that combine technical depth with design clarity. From AI-driven tools to 3D visualisation platforms, I adapt quickly and work across engineering, UX, and business to deliver product-market fit.
- **I’m a versatile contributor who can help teams stay unblocked:** I can code (Python and JavaScript), review PRs on Github, design UI/UX, write content, produce video demos, and run marketing campaigns. I’ve filled gaps in lean teams and helped keep delivery on track.
- **I care deeply about creating inclusive teams** where people feel safe, supported, and empowered. I’ve supported team growth by fostering clear communication, collaborative decision-making, and space for personal development.

# How I work:

Before diving into my work history, here’s what I bring to a team and where I do my best work.

- **End-to-End Product Delivery:** I’ve led new products from concept to launch — turning strategy into execution and driving revenue. I’ve helped teams land six-figure enterprise deals, launch MVPs in 24 hours, and iterate based on real customer feedback.
- **Day-to-Day Team Execution:** I work with developers, designers, and executives to write PRDs, manage scope, and unblock teams. My focus on clear priorities and fast iteration has helped reduce time-to-market and improve delivery consistency.
- **Customer Management:** I’ve run demos, led onboarding, and handled enterprise support. I’m often the first line of support for resolving technical issues that impact delivery or sales opportunities.
- **Knowledge management:** I built knowledge bases that sped up onboarding, streamlined handovers, and cut support requests through clear, accessible content.
- **Funding and Grant Support:** I’ve helped secure early-stage capital and grant funding by writing applications and using my network to win Letters of Intent and bring in early adopters.
