# Here’s a TL;DR on my career:

I'm a product designer turned product manager and developer. I’ve led teams in the UK and Japan and worked in customer-facing roles, delivering products for both early-stage startups and large enterprises.

- I bring hands-on experience in product design, development, and team leadership, having guided products from early validation through to launch. I use fast, low-cost testing with customers to uncover user needs, evaluate technical feasibility, and keep efforts aligned with business goals.
- I thrive on shaping complex, multidisciplinary products that require both technical depth and design sensibility. From machine translation to 3D visualization, I shift gears easily and contribute across a wide range of engineering and design challenges.
- I care deeply about creating inclusive teams where people feel safe, supported, and empowered. That starts with understanding how individuals work, what they need, and how to help them grow together.

# How I work:

Before diving into my work history, here’s a snapshot of the areas I specialise in and the environments where I do my best work.

- **Product management:** Leading and uncovering key information that drives product strategy. I've worked closely with teams, stakeholders, and customers to uncover user needs, validate assumptions, understand technical feasibility and inform strategic decisions.
- **Team management and development process design:** Leading day-to-day execution needed to turn strategy into results. Aligning user, business, and technical needs to create clear, well-informed PRDs and technical briefs. Managing innovation through frequent, incremental improvements informed by testing, feedback, and validation.
- **Knowledge management:** Guiding teams to maintain clear documentation, shared resources, and processes that help teams onboard quickly, collaborate effectively, and retain critical knowledge. I’ve also managed product knowledge by writing and maintaining support articles on Intercom for both customers and external stakeholders.
- **Software Engineering:** I bring hands-on experience in coding with Python and JavaScript, along with cloud platforms like AWS. I actively contribute to GitHub code reviews, and help manage infrastructure and deployments. My background spans UI/UX design, product marketing, and applied data science, and I’m comfortable stepping into different roles to deliver results.
