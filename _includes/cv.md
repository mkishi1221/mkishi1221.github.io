# Here's a TL;DR on my career:

I’m a high-impact product manager and full-stack builder with a strong background in design, data and software development. I've led teams in the UK and Japan and worked in **customer-facing product roles**, at both early-stage startups and large enterprises.

- **I have deep experience driving early-stage products to adoption** by tracking success via customer workshops and experiments using scrappy prototypes, securing enterprise traction and early funding.
- **My superpower is rapidly building and testing prototypes under pressure** and using that hands-on insight to have deep, meaningful conversations that build trust, align cross-functional teams, and drive products to success.
- **I focus on managing the work rather than just the people**, staying closely involved in the details to set clear direction, relentlessly leveling up in unfamiliar areas to uphold high standards, and empowering teams through functional leadership.
- **I bring full-stack leadership with my head in the clouds and feet on the ground** moving fluidly between big-picture strategy and detailed execution across product, engineering, marketing and sales.
- **I've delivered high-impact insight-driven outcomes** by leveraging my data science skills to analyse everything from CAD models and system logs to user sign-up data, uncovering opportunities across product, QA, and marketing.
- **I care deeply about creating inclusive teams** where people feel safe, supported, and empowered. I’ve co-led team growth by fostering clear communication, collaborative decision-making, and space for personal development.

## Product Support Consultant (November 2022 – September 2023) <span class="chip">Remote</span>

Joined Cornwall-based startup Amutri in its early stages, shaping product strategy and driving early traction. Onboarded initial adopters, gathered user feedback, and played a key role in securing grants and pre-seed funding.

- **Shaped product vision and validated market demand** during the company’s pre-funding stage, helping secure early commercial interest and support for grant and pre-seed funding
- **Conducted over 30 discovery interviews** with architects, 3D visualisers, and academic users to uncover pain points, map user journeys, and define MVP requirements
- **Secured multiple Letters of Intent** through targeted outreach and strategic relationship building, providing evidence of demand to support investment and grant applications
- **Designed the product’s first UI and landing page,** defining early UX patterns for cloud-based 3D visualisation and guided walkthrough experiences
- **Automated lead enrichment using Python,** reducing manual admin time from 3 hours to under 10 seconds by extracting company data from user email domains
- **Onboarded and supported early users,** collected structured feedback, and turned insights into actionable product improvements that influenced roadmap and positioning

Joined Amutri full-time as Product Manager based on the success of this work, and was later [interviewed by SETsquared Bristol](https://setsquared-bristol.co.uk/news/amutri-revolutionising-3d-visualisation/){: .cv_link target="_blank" } on Amutri's vision and impact in 3D visualisation.

# SpaceforU (September 2022 – September 2023)

## Co founder and Product Manager <span class="chip">Hybrid</span>

Peer-to-peer marketplace for venue hire across Cornwall and Devon. Selected for Falmouth University’s fully funded startup incubator.

- **Launched an MVP within 24 hours using no-code tools,** enabling live user testing and early market validation
- **Secured partnerships with over 20 venue owners and onboarded 40+ rentable spaces in 3 months,** building initial supply-side liquidity
- **Led product development and UX from concept to launch,** including user flows, conversion-focused landing pages, and mobile booking experience
- **Conducted 40+ user interviews to investigate demand,** identify drop-off points, and refine onboarding and messaging based on real feedback
- **Improved booking flow completion through Figma-based A/B tests** and rapid iteration on search and conversion UX
- **Translated early GTM feedback into product changes** that increased listing completion and reduced user churn during onboarding
- **Owned user acquisition and support for hosts and guests,** converting leads into activated users through hands-on outreach and guided onboarding

After pivoting several times, we found that long-term demand in Cornwall and Devon simply wasn’t strong enough to sustain growth. There weren’t enough experienced organisers to justify building advanced features, and acquiring new or out-of-region event organisers required in-person engagement and marketing spend that resulted in acquisition costs that were too high. We decided to sunset the product based on clear market and user signals.

Here are some snapshots of the homepage and the booking platform.
