# Here's a TL;DR on my career:

I’m a product manager and full-stack MVP builder with 5+ years of experience specialising in validating early-stage ideas and building MVPs at speed. I’ve led 0 to 1 launches of 6+ AI, SaaS, and marketplace products for both B2B and B2C. I've led teams in the UK and in Japan at both early-stage startups and large enterprises.

- **I have deep experience driving early-stage products to adoption** by tracking success via customer workshops and experiments using scrappy prototypes, securing traction and early funding.
- **My superpower is rapidly building and testing prototypes under pressure** and using that hands-on insight to have deep, meaningful conversations that build trust, align cross-functional teams, and drive products to success.
- **I focus on managing the work rather than just the people**, staying closely involved in the details to set clear direction, relentlessly leveling up in unfamiliar areas to uphold high standards, and empowering teams through functional leadership.

I'm open to conversations about new product roles, collaborations, or teams building great products.
