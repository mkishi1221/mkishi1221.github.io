## Here’s a TL;DR on my career:

I'm a product designer turned product manager and developer. I’ve led teams across the UK and Japan in software development, startup growth, and NLP solutions for major Japanese corporations.

- I bring over a decade of design experience and have guided products from early validation through to delivery. I've used  fast, low-cost testing to uncover user needs, assess technical feasibility, and align with business priorities.
- I thrive on shaping complex products that demand both technical depth and strong design sensibility. From machine translation to 3D visualisation, I’ve worked on challenges where engineering and design go hand in hand.
- I care deeply about creating inclusive teams where people feel safe, supported, and empowered. That starts with understanding how individuals work, what they need, and how to help them grow together.

## How I work:

Before diving into my work history, here’s a snapshot of the areas I specialise in and the environments where I do my best work.

- **Product leadership:** Defining product vision and strategy while building cross-functional teams that are collaborative, inclusive, and performance-driven. I've also been responsible for the day-to-day execution needed to turn strategy into results.
- **Product management:** Organising and communicating key information that drives product direction. I work closely with teams, stakeholders, and customers to uncover user needs, validate assumptions, and inform strategic decisions.
- **Team management and development process design:** Aligning user, business, and technical needs to create clear, well-informed PRDs and technical briefs. Enabling innovation through frequent, incremental improvements informed by testing, feedback, and technical validation.
- **Knowledge management:** Guiding teams to maintain clear documentation, shared resources, and processes that help teams onboard quickly, collaborate effectively, and retain critical knowledge. Managing knowledge personally also deepens my understanding of complex products and helps me keep up to date on technical needs.
- **Design, research and Development:** I bring hands-on experience across UI/UX, brand and marketing design, exploratory data analysis and applied data science, automated QA, GitHub-based code review, DevOps, and AWS deployments. I thrive in early-stage teams, stepping into critical gaps to maintain momentum and ensure high-quality delivery.
