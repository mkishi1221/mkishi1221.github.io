# SpaceforU

**SpaceforU is a B2C marketplace connecting venues in Cornwall and Devon with local event organisers.** Designed to streamline fragmented booking process typically handled via emails or phone calls, the platform enabled fast listing creation, real-time availability, and instant bookings. The MVP was launched within 24 hours using no-code tools, allowing for rapid validation, early traction, and user feedback within the first week.

Selected for Falmouth University's fully funded startup incubator and was [featured in a Falmouth University article](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/launchpad/news/entrepreneur-stories-spaceforu){: .cv_link target="_blank" } highlighting regional innovation and early-stage entrepreneurship.

After pivoting several times, we found that long-term demand in Cornwall and Devon simply wasn't strong enough to sustain growth. There weren't enough experienced organisers to justify building advanced features, and acquiring new or out-of-region event organisers required in-person engagement and marketing spend that resulted in acquisition costs that were too high. We decided to sunset the product based on clear market and user signals.
