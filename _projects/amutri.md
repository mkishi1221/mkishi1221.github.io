# Amutri

**Amutri converts complex CAD models into interactive 3D presentations that can be easily shared and understood across entire organisations.** SMR nuclear energy technology is still in development, and these 3D presentations help make their work more tangible to support investment pitches, early sales, and alignment with regulatory requirements.

As Product Manager, I led the product from concept to MVP, delivering 13 core features including Secure Sharing and Guided Tours. These enabled non-technical stakeholders to turn engineering files into shareable presentations and directly contributed to our first enterprise wins in the SMR sector.

Here's a short demo of the product:

## Key Achievements

- **Took a 0 to 1 product to revenue in the AEC and SMR sectors** by delivering core workflows for CAD sharing, real-time 3D collaboration, and Guided Walkthroughs
- **Sole owner of product, design, and data across the business,** filling critical capability gaps and acting as the glue between strategy, delivery, and user experience in an early-stage environment
- **Directed multi-disciplinary teams** across frontend, backend, Unreal Engine and 3D content creation; established agile processes and drove execution toward strategic goals
- **Defined and led the entire product lifecycle,** from roadmap creation and feature scoping to UI/UX design, user validation, and performance measurement through product analytics and telemetry
- **Enabled enterprise adoption by supporting sales**, leading onboarding sessions, running user interviews, and prioritising features for engineering and architectural workflows
- **Led product marketing and created go-to-market assets** including demo videos, marketing site copy, investor pitch decks, and technical documentation
- **Took on key responsibilities beyond product** by designing UI/UX prototypes and workflows, instrumenting telemetry, building admin tools, automating AWS log monitoring with Python and boto3, and resolving CloudWatch errors to support backend reliability
