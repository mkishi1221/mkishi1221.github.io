## About

**I'm spearheading the development of Amutri and revolutionising how people communicate big ideas visually.**

As a product designer with over a decade of experience, I've had the opportunity to contribute to projects on a global scale, collaborating with consultancies and startups in London, Dubai, and Tokyo. I have been involved in a diverse range of projects from designing physical products and interiors, crafting machine translation and NLP solutions for major Japanese corporations, and identifying product-market fit for emerging software startups.

In my current role as a product manager, I am actively involved in building Amutri, a state-of-the-art cloud-rendered BIM to 3D visualization platform. Our startup is dedicated to providing solutions that tackle the challenges associated with complex, time-consuming, and costly 3D content creation for architectural projects.
