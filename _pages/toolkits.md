This page brings together a set of practical templates and guides I've used to support product management and development work. They're intended to make things a bit easier, whether you're outlining a roadmap, writing a spec, or reviewing a new product release.

# PM Toolkits

Templates and guides to help with planning, documenting, and communicating product work clearly and consistently. They've helped me write specs faster, think more clearly during planning, and communicate better with stakeholders.
