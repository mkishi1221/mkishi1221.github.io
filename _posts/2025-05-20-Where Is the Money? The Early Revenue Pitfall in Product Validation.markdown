In the mythology of startups, early revenue is often treated like a badge of validation. “If someone pays, you’re onto something.” It’s a tempting narrative, especially when we're trying to prove momentum. But I've learned we can never truly earn that badge—we have to keep validating with an open mind. Validation isn't about proving ourself right; it's about discovering a great way to deliver long-term value. And just because someone pays once doesn’t mean we’ve built something desirable or sustainable.

Especially if that payment came through an MVP—whether Wizard-of-Oz, Concierge, or a scrappy manual prototype—each has its own quirks and limitations. What looks like traction might actually be the result of overpersonalization, mismatched expectations, or an effort we can’t keep scaling.

## Real Money, Simulated Product

The Wizard-of-Oz MVP is clever: create the illusion of a functioning product while doing everything manually behind the scenes. It’s scrappy. It’s fast. It can yield early cash. With modern tools, we can launch polished, functional-looking websites in just a few days—often for little or no cost. But is that cash a true signal of product-market fit, or just an early mirage?

Amazon offers one of the earliest and most iconic examples of a Wizard-of-Oz MVP. Before building a sophisticated backend or investing heavily in logistics, Jeff Bezos launched a simple website for selling books. When customers placed orders, there was no automated fulfillment system—Bezos and he would manually purchase the books from distributors and ship them to buyers. This lean, behind-the-scenes operation allowed Amazon to validate demand for online book sales without the overhead of building infrastructure prematurely.

Revenue is not binary. It matters why someone paid, what they thought they were buying, and whether they’d do it again without us handholding every step.

Even more importantly: does that same revenue appear when the next version ships?

## Not Just Wizardry: Other Ways to Deliver Early Value

The Wizard-of-Oz approach is just one way to deliver early value—there are countless other ways to build an MVP. Another great example is the Concierge model: offering a transparent, manual service—consulting, coaching, or process execution. Here, the buyer knows they’re purchasing a hands-on solution. There’s no illusion, and the value we’re testing is more grounded.

But the same caveats apply. That service might not translate neatly into a product—maybe the value was how the service was delivered in a personable way. A paying client today doesn’t mean there’s a scalable SaaS business tomorrow. We may find the service solves the problem well, but the product version falls short—or appeals to a different user.

## My First MVP: Domainsmith

I learned this the hard way with my first attempt at a startup: Domainsmith—a tool to help brand designers and entrepreneurs find unique domain names.

The MVP began as a Concierge model. I wrote custom scripts to generate name ideas and ran workshops with over 100 users, manually guiding them through the process. Eventually, some even started paying for the workshop. It felt like early validation. Users told us they couldn’t get similar results from tools like ChatGPT—their outputs were too generic or repetitive.

The idea seemed solid at the time: curate polished, brandable domains and offer them on a subscription basis. But the model had a hidden flaw. Most people only need one domain, and our core users—solo founders and first-timers—had no reason to return. Even with interest and payment upfront, we hit a ceiling quickly. Acquisition was hard, churn was inevitable, and scaling proved impractical.

The MVP gave us a signal, but not a complete picture. It solved a real problem—but not one people needed solved repeatedly or at scale. In hindsight, it was a classic blind spot: early enthusiasm masked by structural limits. I had stopped trying to validate after I started to make some money and focused too much on building something bigger.

## Small Signals, Big Assumptions

Early sales are often drawn from a small, non-representative group: friends, early adopters, and the startup-curious. Their willingness to pay doesn’t tell we how the average buyer will behave. We might be testing generosity, not demand.

The danger lies in extrapolation. A handful of supportive transactions might convince us that we’ve validated the idea—when in fact, we’ve only scratched the surface. It's so important to keep testing the value proposition while expanding the idea.

I saw the same pattern again with SpaceforU, a venue-booking platform. We created a working MVP platform within 24 hours and quickly got some listings. Early bookings gave the impression we had found product-market fit. But as we soon discovered, most of those bookings had come from friends. Their support was generous—but not scalable. The real customers already knew the venues and didn't want to pay to use our platform. Once that goodwill dried up, so did the traffic.

## Think Like a Developer: Atomic Validation

Just as developers commit code atomically—in small, reversible units—I’ve learned it’s an excellent strategy to develop product ideas in the same way. Every small change to the user experience, delivery method, or pricing model can be treated as an independent, testable unit. Make a change, measure the effect, validate or discard.

It’s so tempting to try to pull off a big idea—but validation is complicated, and it’s difficult to clearly understand the facts. We can't teleport our way to a product that delivers big value. We still have to plan the treacherous journey and take it step by step.

Each step—whether moving from a manual process to automation, from service to product, or from niche users to broader audiences—requires new validation. Don’t assume that what worked in step one will still hold in step two. The value proposition may subtly shift. The user expectation may drift. The economics may break.

Validation is not a one-time event. It’s a continuous, iterative process—just like good product development.

## Keep Validating, Always

Whether we’re testing the market with a Wizard-of-Oz product, cobbling together off-the-shelf solutions or delivering services by hand, early revenue is just a signal—not confirmation, not inevitability. Money is important—but only if you know what it means. And only if it keeps showing up when the magic curtain comes down.

So yes, follow the money. But treat each new feature, each shift in delivery, and each product iteration as its own experiment. Build atomically. Test obsessively. Validate continuously.

The real startup magic isn't building a big product. It’s building something that delivers real value and keeps delivering that value as we evolve.
