description: One of the toughest lessons I’ve learned in product - how involving others before truly validating the problem leads to bad debt.

One of the toughest lessons I’ve learned as a product manager is that going all in before finding the right customers rarely ends well. A product doesn’t magically attract users just because it exists. I’ve learned, sometimes painfully, that bringing in teammates, co-founders, or collaborators too early, before deeply validating the problem, creates debt that’s hard to repay.

And when things miss the mark, it’s not just time that’s lost. It’s trust, energy, and goodwill. That’s a heavy cost, and one I’ve since learned to be much more careful about.

I’ve gone all in too soon. I’ve pitched solutions I believed in. I asked engineers, early users, and stakeholders to bet on those ideas. For a long time, I thought if we just pushed hard enough, things would fall into place. **But involving more people doesn’t change a core truth. The idea either solves a real, lasting problem or it doesn’t.**

In fast-moving environments, it’s easy to confuse activity with traction. But without a clear signal from people willing to pay or commit, we’re not really creating something valueable. We’re borrowing. And when we borrow time, energy, or trust without a clear plan to return it, we take on product debt. The kind that quietly compounds until it becomes unsustainable.

## Case Study 1: Domainsmith: A Missed Pivot

Domainsmith was my first startup. It was a domain name generator for brand designers and solo founders. We built it using Python and Nuxt, layering NLP on business descriptions to generate creative domains in real time. Early workshops with over 100 users gave promising feedback, especially since LLMs weren’t yet producing quality results in this space.

The idea made sense: offer curated domains for a small annual fee. But we soon realised most of our users only needed one domain. Retention would be low.

What we didn’t do was test the concept with consultants, investors, or agencies who had ongoing naming needs. We didn’t have strong access to that market, and we ran out of time to pivot. My technical co-founder had already invested significant effort, and I couldn’t deliver a clear path to a return on that commitment. We decided to pause development. The product worked well for one-off use, but we hadn’t validated it with users who would need it more than once for sustained revenue.

## Case Study 2: SpaceforU: Momentum Without a Market

SpaceforU was a venue hire startup I co-founded through Falmouth University’s Launchpad. My co-founder had industry expertise, and I focused on tight feedback loops and fast iteration. We shipped our MVP in 24 hours, listed 40 spaces in a few months, and iterated on the UI based on venue feedback. But we made the same mistake again.

We assumed that securing venue listings was the bottleneck. In reality, many event organisers already had strong relationships with venues. A few of them did book through the platform, but when we spoke to them afterward, the truth became clear. They didn’t actually need it. They were supporting us, not solving a real problem. Eventually, the told us:

“We already know these venues. We already have relationships. Why would we pay to use this?”

We had executed hard but skipped insight. We didn’t properly validate demand before onboarding supply. And as we continued our research, we uncovered something even more fundamental. There simply weren’t that many event organisers in the region. The market was much smaller than we had assumed.

By the time we realised our mistake, we had exhausted the trust and time of our venue partners.

## The Signals Were Always There

Looking back, the most frustrating part is **knowing that the insights we needed didn’t require a product, or even much time.** Just a handful of honest, early conversations could have redirected both products. But we didn’t prioritise that work. We were too confident in what we thought we already knew, and too eager to go all in.

I’ve learned that when we skip foundational validation, we're not placing a bet. We’re passing the risk onto others. And when those bets don’t work out, it’s not just our own time that’s wasted. It’s everyone’s.

## Time Is Not Free.It’s Borrowed

To those I let down: I’m sorry. I gave everything I had. Sleepless nights, long weekends, all the energy I could. But I’ve since learned that conviction and hard work aren’t enough. What matters is: Are we solving the right problem? For the right person? At the right time? Is the MVP feasible?

## My New Rulebook

- Validate before going all in. Don’t rely on instinct or secondhand anecdotes. Talk directly to the people we're trying to help.
- Start small. It’s fine to explore early, but don’t commit heavily until the problem and customer are clear.
- Respect the time of others. Collaborators are not leverage. They’re partners. Don’t ask for their time unless we know how we’ll make it worthwhile.
- Test assumptions with people outside our circle. If our feedback loop only includes our network, we’re testing familiarity, not value.
- Don’t confuse momentum with traction. Moving fast only matters if it gets us closer to something people genuinely want.

## Building With Integrity

I still believe in moving fast. But now, I do it with guardrails. I test the problem before going all in on the solution. I earn the trust of collaborators before asking for their time. And I commit with intention, not on credit, making sure that whatever I create has a clear path to value. Because the hardest lesson in product is that going all in on the wrong thing can cost more than just money. It can cost trust. And once that’s gone, it’s hard to earn back.
