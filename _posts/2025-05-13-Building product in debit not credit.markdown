title:  Building product in debit, not credit
description: One of the toughest lessons I’ve learned in product is that involving others before truly validating the problem doesn’t reduce risk — it just leads to bad debt.

One of the toughest lessons I’ve learned in product is that building something before finding the right customers rarely ends well. A product doesn’t magically attract users just because it exists. I’ve learned the hard way that bringing in teammates, co-founders, or collaborators to build something too early — before the problem is clearly validated with the right people — often creates debt that’s hard to repay. When things miss the mark, it’s not just time that’s lost. It’s the trust, energy, and goodwill of those who believed in it enough to help build. That’s a heavy cost, and one I’ve learned to be much more careful about.

I’ve built too soon. I’ve pitched solutions I was convinced would work. I asked teammates, vendors, and early users to invest their time and energy. **I thought that if we all just pushed hard enough, things would fall into place.** But involving more people doesn’t change the underlying truth — the idea either solves a real, lasting problem, or it doesn’t.

When we’re moving fast, it’s easy to mistake activity for traction. But I’ve learned that without a clear signal from people who are ready to pay or commit, we’re not really building — we’re just accumulating bad debt. We’re borrowing trust, time, and energy from others without knowing if or when we can repay it. And that kind of debt comes with a cost we couldn’t afford.

# Borrowing Time and Trust

In the early stages of startup, it’s tempting to jump ahead. To get people excited, to start building, to assume things will work out. I’ve done that. I’ve asked people to join in on a vision that hadn’t been fully pressure-tested. They assumed I’d done the work. That there were customers behind it. That their effort would pay off.

And when it didn’t, it wasn’t just disappointing — it damaged relationships. It left people frustrated and let down. It's devastating to borrow someone’s time and efforts — and not be able to pay it back.

# Not Being Able to Repay A Technical Co-Founder

Domainsmith was my first attempt at a startup — a tool to help brand designers and entrepreneurs find unique domain names. I managed to convince a developer to join as my co-founder. We built it with Python and Nuxt, used NLP to pull keywords from business plans, and generated domain ideas in real time. I ran workshops with over 100 users, testing it manually, and got promising feedback. At the time, users couldn’t get similar results from existing LLMs — the outputs from ChatGPT were too repetitive and obvious. Things were looking good.

The concept made sense: curate a polished list of unique domains and offer them for a reasonable annual fee. But there was a catch — most people only need one domain. Our core users — solo founders and first-timers — had no reason to come back. And we found it was too impractical to keep trying to find new customers.

There was a more valuable audience — brand consultants, domain investors, creative agencies — but we hadn’t tested with them. We didn’t have the network to reach them, and we ran out of time before we could pivot. The product wasn’t built to sustain a real business, and I couldn’t deliver a return on the time and energy my co-founder had put in.

# Not Being Able to Repay the Venues Who Helped Us

SpaceforU was a venue hire startup I co-founded through Falmouth University’s Launchpad. The pressure was real — we were given six months of runway to get something off the ground. My co-founder brought experience as an event organiser, while I focused on fast builds, tight feedback loops, and tools to help us move quickly. We launched the MVP in 24 hours, listed over 40 spaces within a few months, and iterated the UI based on user feedback.

But we still ended up in the same place.

We spent all our time onboarding venues — taking photos, setting prices, writing listings — and didn’t validate demand from the other side. When we finally sat down with event organisers, the feedback was immediate:

>**“We already know these venues. We already have relationships. Why would we pay to use this?”**

We’d focused on execution over insight. We assumed our backgrounds gave us enough understanding of the market and believed we just needed support from venues — but we hadn’t spoken to people outside our own circle. In theory, we could have reached event organisers beyond Cornwall and Devon, but by the time we realised that, the clock had run out. The venues had given us their time — and we didn’t have anything meaningful to show for it.

# The Signals Were There — But We Bet Too Early

Looking back, **the most frustrating part is knowing that the insights we needed didn’t require a product — or even much time.** Just a handful of honest conversations with the right people, early on, would have pointed us in the right direction. But we didn’t prioritise those conversations.

Instead, we were too focused on what we thought we already knew — and that made it easy to ignore our shortcomings. We thought if we worked hard enough, somehow things will turn out ok. We had bet our time working for people that we couldn't deliver value for.

# Time Has to Be Repaid

To those I’ve let down — I’m sorry. I truly gave it everything I had. I poured in sleepless nights, pushed myself to the edge, and believed that if we just worked hard enough, things would eventually fall into place. But I’ve learned that’s not how you really build a startup.

It’s easy to believe we’ll figure things out before the runway runs out. But when we don’t, it’s not just our time that’s lost — it’s the trust of those who believed in us and gave their time, energy, and support along the way.

I don’t think the ideas we worked on were inherently flawed. Perhaps, with more time to pivot, we could have made it work. But it's important to spend time within your means—it’s easy to get stuck chasing potential that never quite materialises. Our time is acutely limited, and we were all too eager to spend it just to get something built. Once we asked others to back those bets, it wasn’t just our time on the line anymore. At that point, we couldn’t afford to keep experimenting — we needed to be sure we were solving the right problem.

Before asking anyone to invest their time, energy, or money, I now ask myself: Have I done the work? Have I spoken to the people about what they truly need over the long term? Could I confidently introduce them for tough questioning? And have I truly listened — testing my assumptions with people beyond my immediate circle?

If the answer is no — I go back to outreach. Because we have to be able to deal in debit, not credit. Building before we're ready doesn’t just waste time. It might cost us something we we may never fully get back.
