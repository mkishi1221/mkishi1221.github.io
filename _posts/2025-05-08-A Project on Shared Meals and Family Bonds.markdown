*This project is from June 2016.*

How can design encourage families to spend more time together? Can a simple object spark moments of connection and support our mental well-being?

In June 2016, I created a project called *Efflorescence*, a quiet exploration of how mealtime rituals can strengthen relationships. The idea was simple: individual herb pots that, when brought together, form a blooming arrangement. Each pot could be cared for by a different person, turning plant care into a shared activity.

The act of growing fresh herbs brings more than just flavor. It adds color, scent, and a sense of occasion to everyday meals. It invites people to slow down and connect. The design supports this through practical details: magnets for attaching to fridges, a tilted form for easy access, and the ability to hang from kitchen rails or windows. A self-draining soil compartment keeps maintenance simple and low-stress.

This wasnâ€™t just about growing herbs. It was about creating small moments that made everyday interactions feel more meaningful. The project still reminds me that simple, intentional design choices can leave a lasting emotional impact.
