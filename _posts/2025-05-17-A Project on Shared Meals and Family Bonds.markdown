*This project is from June 2016.*

How can design encourage families to spend more time together? Can a simple object spark moments of connection and support our mental well-being?

In June 2016, I created a project called *Efflorescence*—a quiet exploration of how mealtime rituals can strengthen relationships. The idea was simple: individual herb pots that, when brought together, form a blooming arrangement. Each pot could be cared for by a different person, turning plant care into a shared activity.

The act of growing fresh herbs brings more than flavor. It adds color, scent, and a sense of occasion to daily meals—inviting people to slow down and connect. The design supports this with thoughtful features: magnets for attaching to fridges, a tilted form for easy access, and the ability to hang from kitchen rails or windows. A self-draining soil compartment makes upkeep simple and stress-free.

This wasn’t just about growing herbs. It was about growing moments—making everyday interactions feel a little more meaningful. The project continues to remind me that small, intentional design choices can have a lasting emotional impact.
